# Crud Operations

## Description
This is a sample project for demonstrating Crud Operations in Node js Using PostresSQL.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
- Run the application: `npm start`
- Access the API endpoints at `http://localhost:3000/api`

## API Documentation
- GET /api/users/:id - Get user details
- For more information related API documentation visit https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33131469/2sA2xb6Fn4
  

## Development Setup
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## This Task covers the following requirements

-Setup a PostgreSQL database with a sample schema that includes at least one table. - Develop API endpoints using Node.js and Express.js framework to perform CRUD operations on the PostgreSQL database.


- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints. Only authenticated users should be able to access the CRUD operations. Use token-based authentication (JWT) or session-based authentication as per your preference.


- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).


- Ensure that sensitive data such as passwords and access tokens are securely stored and transmitted using encryption (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing, HTTPS for secure communication).


- Implement input validation and sanitization to protect against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).


- Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.


- Document your code adequately, including API documentation and instructions for setting up the development environment and running the application.
